# Technical Resources

Throughout my career, my favorite question to ask fellow software engineers and product managers has been "What are your favorite resources?". This allowed me to compile a list of materials that continues to power my career. This collection of books, videos, papers and articles spans some of the most important topics in the technical landscape. I hope this provides others with a clear guide to unlock new areas of understanding and personal development.
